The C programming language provides a set of functions in the standard library for manipulating strings. These functions allow operations such as copying, concatenating, tokenizing, and searching strings. One important convention in C is that strings are represented as null-terminated arrays, where the last element is a null character ('\0').
In the header file "string.h", you'll find several types, macros, and functions related to string operations. Here's an overview of some of the elements you mentioned:
Types:
1. size_t: This is an unsigned integral type that represents the result of the sizeof keyword. It is commonly used for expressing sizes and indices in string operations.
Macros:
1. NULL: This macro represents the value of a null pointer constant. It is often used to indicate the absence of a valid memory address.
Functions:
1. void *memchr(const void *str, int c, size_t n): This function searches for the first occurrence of the character 'c' (an unsigned char) in the first 'n' bytes of the memory block pointed to by 'str'. It returns a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if 'c' is not found.
2. int memcmp(const void *str1, const void *str2, size_t n): This function compares the first 'n' bytes of the memory blocks pointed to by 'str1' and 'str2'. It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on whether 'str1' is less than, equal to, or greater than 'str2'.
3. void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n): This function copies 'n' bytes from the memory block pointed to by 'src' to the memory block pointed to by 'dest'. It returns 'dest' as the result.
4. void *memset(void *str, int c, size_t n): This function fills the first 'n' bytes of the memory block pointed to by 'str' with the value of 'c' (an unsigned char). It returns 'str' as the result.
5. char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n): This function appends at most 'n' characters from the string pointed to by 'src' to the end of the string pointed to by 'dest'. It returns 'dest' as the result.
6. char *strchr(const char *str, int c): This function searches for the first occurrence of the character 'c' (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by 'str'. It returns a pointer to the matching character or NULL if 'c' is not found.
7. int strncmp(const char *str1, const char *str2, size_t n): This function compares at most 'n' characters of the strings pointed to by 'str1' and 'str2'. It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on whether 'str1' is less than, equal to, or greater than 'str2'.
8. char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n): This function copies at most 'n' characters from the string pointed to by 'src' to the string pointed to by 'dest'. It returns 'dest' as the result.
These functions are just a subset of the string operations available in C. They provide powerful capabilities for manipulating strings efficiently.
